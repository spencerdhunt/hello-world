======================

Hello all!

Things about myself, hmm?  That is a very loaded question, mostly because I am often loaded.  That's a joke!  But seriously, a nice cold beer is quite good.  I also enjoy long walks on the beach, open dialogue about our hopes and dreams, and making fun of cultural media by sarcastically buying into it.  Is that a hipster thing to do?  I don't know, I think I'd rather NOT know to be honest.
